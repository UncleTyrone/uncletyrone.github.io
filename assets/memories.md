   - Added volume slider with range input (0-1)
   - Added mute button with dynamic icon based on volume level

   - Added volume state management (`volume`, `isMuted`)

3. **Seeking Functionality Restored**
   - Made progress bar clickable for seeking
   - Added `handleProgressClick` function to calculate new time position
   - Added `progressBarRef` for DOM reference
   - Added mouse event handlers for drag functionality

4. **Timecode Tracking Fixed**
