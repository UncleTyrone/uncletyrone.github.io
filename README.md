## Customization

### Colors and Styling
- Edit `src/App.css` to customize colors, fonts, and styling
- The main color scheme uses blue accents (`#60a5fa`, `#3b82f6`)

### GitHub API
- The website automatically fetches your public repositories
- Contributions are shown as forked repositories (simplified approach)
- For more advanced contribution tracking, you'd need to use GitHub's GraphQL API

### Music Player
- Supports 5 tracks maximum
- Clean, minimal design with play/pause, next/previous controls
- Shows track progress and time
- Displays track images next to track names
- Responsive design that adapts to mobile screens

## Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Notes

- Video background is optimized for web
- Music files should be compressed for faster loading
- Images are optimized and use modern formats

## Troubleshooting

### Video Not Playing
- Ensure the video is in MP4 format
- Check that the file is named `background.mp4` in the `public` folder
- Some browsers may require user interaction before autoplay

### Music Not Playing
- Ensure MP3 files are in the `public/music/` folder
- Check file names match exactly: `track1.mp3`, `track2.mp3`, etc.
- Some browsers may block autoplay - user interaction required

### GitHub API Issues
- Check your GitHub username is correct in the API calls
- Ensure your repositories are public
- API rate limits may apply (60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests)
